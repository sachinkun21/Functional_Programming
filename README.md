For loops are a Swiss army knife for problem-solving, but, when it comes to scanning code to get a quick read of what you’ve done, they can be overwhelming.

Three techniques — map, filter, and reduce — help remedy the for loop mania by offering functional alternatives that describe why you’re iterating.


- **Map**: Apply the same set of steps to each item, storing the result.
- **Filter:** Apply validation criteria, storing items that evaluate True.
- **Reduce:** Return a value that is passed from element to element.
